I'm excited to present two papers at NAACL 2025: ["CoRAG: Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation"](https://lnkd.in/eTyWXgu6) and ["Decoding Dark Matter: Specialized Sparse Autoencoders for Interpreting Rare Concepts in Foundation Models"](https://lnkd.in/ef_M5a7u), with the latter also featuring an oral presentation at the [TrustNLP Workshop](https://trustnlpworkshop.github.io/).

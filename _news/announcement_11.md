Our work *Inducing Elasticity in Foundation Models: Post-Training Techniques for Adaptable Inference* was accepted at the [The 4th Workshop on Efficient Natural Language and Speech Processing](https://neurips2024-enlsp.github.io/) @ NeurIPS 2024. We study weight decomposition approaches to induce elasticity in pretrained LLMs.

I'm excited to be a mentor for [SPAR 2025](https://sparai.org/)! I'll be mentoring students on mechanistic alignment techniques using Sparse Autoencoders to make AI systems more interpretable and robustly aligned. If you're interested in advancing AI safety through hands-on interpretability research, please apply!

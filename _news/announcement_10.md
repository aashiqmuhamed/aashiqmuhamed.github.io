I will be presenting my MATS project, *"Decoding Dark Matter: Specialized Sparse Autoencoders for Interpreting Rare Concepts in LLMs,"* at the [Second NeurIPS Workshop on Attributing Model Behavior at Scale](https://attrib-workshop.cc/). Our results show that SSAEs pareto dominate pretrained SAEs within specific subdomains, with promising implications for broader applications in AI safety.

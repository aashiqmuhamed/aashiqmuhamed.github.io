Hi, I'm Aashiq, a first-year MS/Ph.D. student at [CMU Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/), advised by Professors [Mona Diab](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/222228496/mona-diab) and [Virginia Smith](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~smithv/). 

My research interests are broadly in the area of responsible AI. Topics Iâ€™m interested in include (but are not limited to):

- AI alignment and safety
- Algorithmic fairness
- Federated learning in LLMs
- New privacy-preserving algorithms
- NLP applications for social good.

I hold a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, where I was the President's Gold Medalist. I also completed my MS at Stanford University. 

Before embarking on my Ph.D. journey, I accrued five years of industry experience, working as an Applied Scientist at AWS DeepComposer (2019-2021), Amazon Search M5 (2021-2022), and AWS AI (2022-2023).

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in my research or contemplating a Ph.D. after industry experience.

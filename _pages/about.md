Hi, I'm Aashiq, a Ph.D. student in the [CMU Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/), where I'm advised by Professors [Mona Diab](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/222228496/mona-diab) and [Virginia Smith](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~smithv/). 

My research focuses on developing responsible AI systems that are safe, efficient, and aligned with human values. I'm particularly interested in:

- **Foundations of Mechanistic Interpretability and AI Safety**: Sparse autoencoders for foundation model interpretability, machine unlearning methods, and safety mechanisms for large language models
- **Efficient Foundation Model Training and Inference**: Structured sparsity techniques, memory-efficient training algorithms, federated learning, and computational optimization for large-scale models
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Collaborative RAG systems, LLM-as-a-judge frameworks, and novel evaluation paradigms for foundation models
- **Technical AI Governance**: Technical research infrastructure and methodologies to support effective AI governance, policy implementation, and regulatory frameworks

## background

I bring a unique interdisciplinary perspective to my research, with degrees spanning engineering, language technologies, and machine learning. I earned my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, where I was awarded the President's Gold Medal. I subsequently completed an MS in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University and an MS in Language Technologies from the [CMU Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/).

Before beginning my Ph.D., I spent five years in industry as an Applied Scientist at Amazon, working across diverse AI applications including AWS DeepComposer (2019-2021), Amazon Search M5 (2021-2022), and AWS AI (2022-2023). This industry experience has shaped my research approach, emphasizing both theoretical rigor and practical impact.

## collaboration

I'm always excited to collaborate with fellow researchers at CMU and beyond. If you're working on related problems or interested in exploring research opportunities together, I'd love to hear from you. 

For prospective collaborators at CMU, please feel free to fill out this brief [collaboration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeGCF8kjBqfPZfXIc8NB6LRAXhRxOZ_9DydA5nGi77NR3W5dg/viewform?usp=header) to help me understand your interests and backgroundâ€”though don't hesitate to reach out directly regardless.

I'm also happy to chat with anyone considering a Ph.D. after industry experience, as I know firsthand how rewarding (and challenging) that transition can be.

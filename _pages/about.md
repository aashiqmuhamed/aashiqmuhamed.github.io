Hi, my name is Aashiq. I am a first year MS/Ph.D. Student at the Language Technologies Institute in the Computer Science Department at CMU.
I am advised by [Mona Diab](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/222228496/mona-diab) and [Virginia Smith](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~smithv/).

My research interests are broadly in the area of responsible AI. Topics Iâ€™m interested in include (but are not limited to):

AI alignment and safety
Algorithmic Fairness
Federated learning in LLMs
Privacy 
NLP for social good

I completed my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee here I was honored as the President's gold medalist, and my MS at Stanford University. Before starting my Ph.D., I spent around 5 years in industry working as an Applied Scientist at AWS DeepComposer (2019-2021), Amazon Search M5 (2021-2022), and AWS AI (2022-2023). If you are interested in any of my research topics or considering a Ph.D. after industry feel free to reach out.

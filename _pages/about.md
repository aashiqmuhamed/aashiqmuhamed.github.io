Hi, I'm Aashiq, a Ph.D. student in the [CMU Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/), where I'm advised by Professors [Mona Diab](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/222228496/mona-diab) and [Virginia Smith](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~smithv/). I also closely collaborate with Professor [Andrew Ilyas](https://andrewilyas.com/).

My research develops the **science and safety infrastructure for autonomous agentic systems**. I work on both the foundational interpretability methods needed to understand how models reason internally, and the applied tools to monitor and govern agents in deployment. I'm particularly interested in:

- **Foundations of Mechanistic Interpretability**: Developing SAEs, circuit analysis, and interpretability methods to understand model internals—including feature consistency, rare concept detection, unlearning, and the geometry of learned representations.
- **Interpretability of Reasoning Models**: Understanding how reasoning capabilities emerge and can be intervened on during training across paradigms (SFT, RLVR, and beyond), and what drives robustness in finetuned reasoning models.
- **Agent Safety Monitoring and Evaluation**: What makes an effective safety monitor? I study chain-of-thought monitoring, mechanistic monitors, and benchmarking their robustness against direct misuse and evasion.
- **Multi-Agent Collusion and Coordination**: Using mechanistic tools to detect and understand collusion, deception, and covert coordination in multi-agent systems.
- **Tamper Resistance and Open-Weight Safety**: Making safety properties robust in open-weight models where adversaries have full access to modify weights.

I am supported by the [Amazon PhD Fellowship](https://www.amazon.science/academic-engagements/2025-amazon-phd-fellows), [Anthropic Fellows Program](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-fellows-program), the [Siebel Scholars Foundation](https://www.siebelscholars.com/scholar/aashiq-muhamed/), the [Cooperative AI Foundation](https://www.cooperativeai.com/), [Longview Philanthropy](https://www.longview.org/), and [MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org/alumni/aashiq-muhamed).

## background

I bring an interdisciplinary perspective, with degrees spanning engineering, language technologies, and machine learning. I earned my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, where I was awarded the President's Gold Medal. I subsequently completed an MS in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University and an MS in Language Technologies from the [CMU Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/).

Before beginning my Ph.D., I spent five years in industry as an Applied Scientist at Amazon, working across diverse AI applications including AWS DeepComposer (2019-2021), Amazon Search M5 (2021-2022), and AWS AI (2022-2023). This industry experience deeply informs my research, emphasizing systems that are both theoretically grounded and practically deployable.

## collaboration

I'm always excited to collaborate with fellow researchers at CMU and beyond. If you're working on related problems or interested in exploring research opportunities together, I'd love to hear from you.

For prospective collaborators at CMU, please feel free to fill out this brief [collaboration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeGCF8kjBqfPZfXIc8NB6LRAXhRxOZ_9DydA5nGi77NR3W5dg/viewform?usp=header) to help me understand your interests and background—though don't hesitate to reach out directly regardless.

I'm also happy to chat with anyone considering a Ph.D. after industry experience, as I know firsthand how rewarding (and challenging) that transition can be.
